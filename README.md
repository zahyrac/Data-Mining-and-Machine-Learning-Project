# Data Mining and Machine Learning Project
Successfully established the risk levels of becoming a drug user with the use of machine learning algorithms

In the United States, deaths due to drug overdose hit its highest records last year and continues to increase at  a  rapid  speed.  In  order  to  alleviate  such  huge  losses  effective  measures  need  to  be  taken. Therefore, this project aimed to:

1.  Identify which of the different drug substances can be bought together or if there is any association between these substances. Use of Apriori association for this Market basket analysis of different drug substances in the study.

2. Evaluate the risk of being a drug consumer/user for each of the drug class (drug substance) based on demographic and behavioral data.
a. Asses if the data can be used to predict the class label (different usage pattern) for each of the different drug classes (drug substance) separately.
b. Asses if the problem can be converted into binary classification and check if each respondent is User or Non-user for the drug.

3. Identify if there is any correlation between:
a. Predictability of binary drugs consumptions using Demographic and Behavioral attributes separately
b. Demographic attributes (e.g. age, education, ethnicity, etc.) and drug substance consumption
c. Behavioral attributes (e.g. Escore, Ascore, Impulsive Score, etc.) and drug substance consumption
d. Correlation within Behavioral attributes
